# prova_sicredi
This is my Sicredi test using Maven, Eclipse IDE and page objects pattern.
A Page Object simply models these as objects within the test code. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes, the fix need only be applied in one place.

There are basically 3 classes:
- Page: where the UI elements are mapped
- Workflow: workflows to manipulate the page object
- AppTest: Where the test are created
